# Dropbox OAuth Integration - Fix Summary

## Problem
The Dropbox OAuth callback wasn't working properly. When users authorized the app, they would see the callback URL with a code parameter, but no handler was processing it.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Backend Changes** (`backend/routes/dropbox.js`)

#### Added OAuth Callback Route
- **New Route**: `GET /callback`
- This route receives the authorization code from Dropbox after user authorization
- Automatically exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
- Redirects back to frontend with tokens in URL parameters

Key features:
- Handles both success and error cases
- Exchanges authorization code for tokens automatically
- Includes proper error logging
- Uses the correct redirect URI from environment variables

#### Updated Auth URL Generator
- Simplified to always use production URL: `https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/dropbox-callback`
- Removed complex origin detection logic
- More reliable and predictable

### 2. **Backend Changes** (`backend/server.js`)

#### Added Root-Level Callback Route
```javascript
app.get('/dropbox-callback', (req, res, next) => {
  req.url = '/callback';
  dropboxRoutes(req, res, next);
});
```

This forwards requests from `https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/dropbox-callback` to the Dropbox router's callback handler.

### 3. **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/pages/DropboxCallback.jsx`)

#### Created New Callback Page
A React component that:
- Captures tokens from URL parameters
- Stores them in localStorage:
  - `dropboxAccessToken`
  - `dropboxRefreshToken`
  - `dropboxTokenExpiry`
- Shows user-friendly success/error messages
- Automatically redirects back to transactions page
- Handles pending uploads (if user was trying to upload before auth)

### 4. **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/App.js`)

#### Added Route for Callback Page
```javascript
<Route
  path="/dropbox-callback"
  element={<DropboxCallback />}
/>
```

This makes the callback page publicly accessible (no auth required) so OAuth can complete.

## How It Works Now

### Complete OAuth Flow:

1. **User Clicks "Connect Dropbox"** (in TradeDetailsModal or similar)
   - Frontend calls: `GET /api/dropbox/auth-url`
   - Backend returns: Dropbox authorization URL

2. **User Authorizes on Dropbox**
   - Redirected to: `https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?...`
   - User grants permission

3. **Dropbox Redirects Back** ✅ NEW
   - Redirects to: `https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/dropbox-callback?code=...`
   - Backend route `/dropbox-callback` catches this

4. **Backend Exchanges Code for Tokens** ✅ NEW
   - Calls Dropbox API: `POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token`
   - Receives: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_in`

5. **Backend Redirects to Frontend** ✅ NEW
   - Redirects to: `https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/settings?dropbox_success=true&access_token=...&refresh_token=...`

6. **Frontend Stores Tokens** ✅ NEW
   - `DropboxCallback` component captures URL parameters
   - Stores tokens in localStorage
   - Shows success message
   - Redirects to transactions page

## Configuration Requirements

### Dropbox App Console Settings
Make sure this redirect URI is added to your Dropbox App:

1. Go to: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
2. Select your app: **hkxnvciw8hwlxob**
3. Add to "Redirect URIs":
   ```
   https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/dropbox-callback
   ```
4. Click **Submit** to save

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
Already configured correctly:
```env
DROPBOX_APP_KEY=hkxnvciw8hwlxob
DROPBOX_APP_SECRET=7gpormhtp0s3c4b
FRONTEND_URL=https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca
```

## Testing

### To Test the Fix:

1. **Restart Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm restart
   # or if using pm2:
   pm2 restart homelife
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Storage**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Application tab → Local Storage
   - Clear any old Dropbox tokens

3. **Test OAuth Flow**
   - Go to Transactions page
   - Click "Connect to Dropbox" on any trade
   - Authorize on Dropbox
   - Should redirect back and show success message
   - Tokens should be stored in localStorage

4. **Test Upload**
   - Try uploading a PDF to Dropbox
   - Should work without re-authentication

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect_uri" Error
- **Cause**: Redirect URI not registered in Dropbox App Console
- **Fix**: Add `https://homelife.brokeragelead.ca/dropbox-callback` to Dropbox App settings

### Tokens Not Saving
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Check**: Network tab to see if callback route is being hit
- **Check**: Backend logs for token exchange errors

### Token Exchange Fails
- **Check**: `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` is correct in `.env`
- **Check**: Authorization code hasn't expired (they expire quickly)
- **Check**: Backend logs for API errors

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ✅ `backend/routes/dropbox.js` - Added callback handler and updated auth URL
- ✅ `backend/server.js` - Added root-level callback route

### Frontend
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/DropboxCallback.jsx` - New callback page component
- ✅ `frontend/src/App.js` - Added route for callback page

## Next Steps

After deploying these changes:

1. ✅ Verify redirect URI in Dropbox App Console
2. ✅ Restart backend server
3. ✅ Test complete OAuth flow
4. ✅ Verify tokens are stored correctly
5. ✅ Test PDF upload to Dropbox

## Notes

- The authorization code in your URL (`V0PGxJD-zPAAAAAAAAAApfK-Z6r763wVsw2mmjrMhOA`) is **single-use** and expires quickly
- After implementing this fix, you'll need to go through the OAuth flow again
- Refresh tokens last forever (until revoked), so users only need to authenticate once
- Access tokens expire after 4 hours but can be refreshed automatically using the refresh token
